# ColdBrew-OS
I was always fortunate in college to have received great instruction in operating systems and systems programming fundamentals. However, I never really got the chance to dive head first in writing some of this code from total scratch. This repository is a free-time project of mine to explore this. I'm aiming for something making use of x86 long mode (64 bit) that can read from disk, and feature some form of basic shell and commands written in both assembly and C.

Wish me luck on my journey!
